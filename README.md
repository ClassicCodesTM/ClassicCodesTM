- Hi, I’m @ClassicCodesTM
- I'm a Michigan Technological University alumni (2015) with a BA in Physics and a minor in Math.
- I've worked at a plastic injection molding plant in the Automotive industry between 2015 and 2022 as first a process engineer and then essentially an Eng/Mfg/QA manager.
- I’m interested in exploring career opportunities in programming and improving my programming skill set.
- I’m currently learning on CodeAcademy, starting at a basic level to give myself a better idea of what my options are and where my career interests may lie.
- I've always been passionate about video games ever since my dad introduced me to the Atari at a very young age and would love to break into that industry.
- How to reach me: cjsalmon@mtu.edu (this is a permanent email address)
